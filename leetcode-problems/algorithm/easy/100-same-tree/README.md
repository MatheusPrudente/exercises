## [100. Same Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/description/)
<code>Easy</code>

<br>
Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.
<br>

#### Example 1:

> __Input:__ p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]  
> __Output:__ true  

#### Example 2:

>__Input:__ p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]  
> __Output:__ false  

#### Example 3:


> __Input:__p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]  
> __Output:__ false  
 

#### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in both trees is in the range <code>[0, 100]</code>
- <code>-104 <= Node.val <= 104</code>

## [191. Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/description/)
<code>Easy</code>

<br>
Write a function that takes the binary representation of a positive integer and returns the number of 
set bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
<br>
 

#### Example 1:

> __Input:__ n = 11  
> __Output:__ 3  
> __Explanation:__ The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.  

#### Example 2:

> __Input:__ n = 128  
> __Output:__ 1  
> __Explanation:__ The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.  

#### Example 3:

> __Input:__ n = 2147483645  
> __Output:__ 30  
> __Explanation:__ The input binary string 1111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty set bits.  

 

#### Constraints:

- <code>1 <= n <= 231 - 1</code>

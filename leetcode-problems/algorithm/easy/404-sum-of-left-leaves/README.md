## [404. Sum of Left Leaves](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-left-leaves/description/)

<code>Easy</code>

<br>
Given the <code>root</code>code> of a binary tree, return the sum of all left leaves.

A __leaf__ is a node with no children. A __left leaf__ is a leaf that is the left child of another node.
</br>
 

### Example 1:


> __Input:__  root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]  
> __Output:__  24  
> __Explanation:__  There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively.  

### Example 2:

> __Input:__  root = [1]  
> __Output:__  0  
 

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[1, 1000]</code>.
- <code>-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000</code>
